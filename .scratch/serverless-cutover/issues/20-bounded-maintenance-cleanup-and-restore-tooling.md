# 20 - Bounded maintenance, cleanup and restore tooling

**What to build:** Bounded maintenance, cleanup and restore tooling.

**Blocked by:** 04, 05, 07, 19

**Status:** ready-for-agent

**Spec:** [Serverless cutover](../spec.md)

- **Build:** hourly safety reconciliation; daily retention, source purge, event/task cleanup, grant expiry and pending-workspace cleanup with durable continuation; exact-key Media Cleanup with holds; restore/epoch invalidation and redispatch procedure.
- **Accept:** an empty pass stops promptly. Referenced or held objects survive. After a restore, old executions can't commit and accepted obligations recover.
